Journal Entry:

So far in code 201 I have learned quite a few topics that will be the foundation of my coding knowledge. I have already begun to implement these topics in assignments for code 201. Implementing these learned topics helps reinforce them for future reference. A few topics that still confuse me are as follows: properly implementing a function on a page, calling a function inside another function, and using arrays with functions.

Today we added constructor functions into our webpages as well as a table to show the daily sales estimates by hour per location. We also learned about object oriented programming.

Today in lecture we went over a big review of our code for our Salmon Cookies project. A lot of time was spent going over how to properly implement the table in JS and HTML. We also were tasked with going over our CSS and HTML and adding more styling to our pages.

Today in lecture we went over forms, HTML tables, and event listeners. We also did a recap of JS constructor functions, which I still struggle with a little. In lab we then added a form to our html and JS files. I then attempted to use an event listener in my JS file to populate a new table row on my webpage.

On Friday 12/15 we were assigned partners for our Chocolate Pizza project and after lecture we began working on the project. Me and my partner started with a new repo on GitHub and added myself as a contributor, then we made an HTML scaffold and began editing the CSS. We finished the project over the course of the weekend by tweaking the HTML positioning and a few CSS features as well as a form for our ingredients list. Our reading for the weekend covered JS debugging using console.log and various developer tools.

Today in lecture we reviewed the code from Chocolate Pizza projects and discussed code differences as well as a recap of JS debugging and error handling from last week. Then we began delving into audio and video in HTML and how to implement them on our pages, we ended with revisiting domain modeling.
