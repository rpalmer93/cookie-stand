Journal Entry:

So far in code 201 I have learned quite a few topics that will be the foundation of my coding knowledge. I have already begun to implement these topics in assignments for code 201. Implementing these learned topics helps reinforce them for future reference. A few topics that still confuse me are as follows: properly implementing a function on a page, calling a function inside another function, and using arrays with functions.
